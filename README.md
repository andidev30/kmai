> “An AI that supports teachers, not replaces them.”

## 🧠 Ideation

In recent years, AI has been widely used to **assist students in learning**, through virtual tutors and practice platforms.  
However, **teachers have not received the same level of support**.

In Indonesia, one teacher may handle **20–30 students per class**, while also managing administrative work such as:

- preparing lesson materials and exam questions,
- grading assignments,
- recording scores and tracking student progress.

These tasks take up a significant amount of time and energy — time that could otherwise be used for **teaching and interacting with students**.

**KM.ai** is designed as a _digital assistant for teachers_ to help reduce this workload.  
This AI can:

- generate teaching materials based on a teacher’s ideas or templates,
- automatically create diverse question sets to promote fairness and efficiency,
- provide progress summaries to help teachers adjust their teaching methods to each class’s needs.

## 🔤 About the Name — **KM.ai**

The name **KM.ai** comes from the Indonesian term **“Ketua Murid”**, which translates to _Class President_.  
In Indonesian schools, the _Ketua Murid_ is known as the student who **helps the teacher and supports classmates** — wiping the board, organizing materials, or keeping the class orderly.

That same spirit defines KM.ai:

> **An AI that assists teachers in managing lessons and classrooms more effectively.**
